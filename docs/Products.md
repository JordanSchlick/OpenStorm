# Radar Products


## Base Product Types
Base products are generated by the radar with minimal processing

### Reflectivity (REF)
The most commonly used product. It indicates how much of the radar was reflected and corresponds to how dense the precipitation is.

### Radial Velocity (RV)
How fast the precipitation is moving towards or away from the radar.

### Spectrum Width (SW)
How much variation there is within the radial velocity.


## Derived Product Types
Derived products are generated from the base products within OpenStorm

### Radial Velocity De-aliased (RVD)
Dependencies: Radial Velocity  
Radial velocity has some artifacts where the velocity wraps around to the wrong direction. 
This derived products tries remove them, but does not always work perfect.



## Adding a product
* Add a volume type in RadarData.h
* Create a new class derived from RadarProduct. Look at RadarProductVelocityDealiased for an example.
* Add that new product to the list in ProductList.cpp
* Add a new color index if necessary
* Modify RadarColorIndex::GetDefaultColorIndexForData to choose the correct color index for the data
* Rebuild the project outside of the editor to apply the changes in ProductList.cpp live build will not properly update it
